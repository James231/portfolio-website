# Portfolio Website
This is a very simple Portfolio website I used to use, with a white / dark grey / green colour theme. It contains 4 main pages: Home, Interests, Projects, and Request CV. There are also a few project pages to demonstrate how to add your own. The Contact Form on the Request CV page does not work out of the box. You'll need to add your own server-side code or JavaScript to get it working. I recommend using Google Apps Script. It is free and you can send yourself an email with the submitted message, while storing them in a Google Spreadsheet. Furthermore, the CSS is entirely custom made. There are no dependancies.
